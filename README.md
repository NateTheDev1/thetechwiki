# Summary

**The Tech Wiki** is a collective focused community meant to be run by people who come together to make information on tech and engineering topics be as open, accessible, factual, and easy to find as possible.
<br></br>
To keep the standards envisioned by the community, all information will be carefully reviewed, tested (if applicable), and cross-referenced to ensure proper information is being distributed to keep the community a safe place that stays consistent with our values.
<br></br>
